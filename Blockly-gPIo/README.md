# Blockly-gPIo
Visual programming for the Raspberry Pi with access to the GPIO and a simple browser-based simulation mode.

Currently this is just a proof of concept, not even an MVP, hacked together in a small amount of time just to see what the idea might look like.

Inspired by a talk from [bennuttall](https://github.com/bennuttall) about [gpiozero](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-gpiozero).
